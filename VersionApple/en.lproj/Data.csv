Trip to the camp and back;km to camp site;;9999;0;;;;1;;;;"A nearby camp site limits the distance travelled, and allows to choose less harmful transportation means. Except if the short distance translates into many roundtrips by car. \n\nTip\nIf you use several means of transportation, select here the one that is used on the longer distance. The remaining move can be included in the ""On-site mobility"" section below.";;;;;km to camp site;
